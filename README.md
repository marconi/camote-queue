Camote Queue
============

Camote Queue is a [Python](http://python.org/) implementation of a [queue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue) on top of [Redis](http://redis.io/) that supports introspecting a job's position in the queue.

### Why another queue?

I've tried a couple of existing queue implementation and none of them supports fetching the job's position in the queue, hence Camote Queue was born.

### What's with the name?

Camote Queue is a snack I used to buy when I was a kid, its basically slices of fried sweet patato (Camote) covered with melted sugar and stacked (like a queue) in a stick.

### TODO

- Write proper tests. :)
